# Travelers-2017-competition

# About Travelers competition:
Business problems: The data set is based on 4 years of property insurance policies from 2013 to 2016. There are roughly 7500 policies in the training data and each policy only has one observation. There are almost 2000 policies that were canceled during the effective term



# About the process of building the models:
I built three models including SVM, GBC, logistic in scikit-learn package.
Also, I applied grid search to find the best parameters for the training dataset in order to get the highest accuracy.

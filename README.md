# Travelers-2017-competition

# About Travelers competition:
This is a contest for building predictive models to detect what kind of claim holder will have a higher tendency to cancel their service. 

# About the process of building the models:
I built three models including SVM, GBC, logistic in scikit-learn package.
Also, I applied grid search to find the best parameters for the training dataset in order to get the highest accuracy.
